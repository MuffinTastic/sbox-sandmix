# s&mix

This is a dynamic node-based sound mixer for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/about/). Inspired *heavily* by Source 2's built-in VMix, it allows one to create fully dynamic soundtracks for their game, applying various effects and filters in response to things taking place in-game, via values sent by game code.
